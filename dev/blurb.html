		BLUESIM is a web application designed for the creation of custom simulations. The UI allows for creating simulations with drag and drop entities and reviewing simulation results with graphs and animations, making BLUESIM manageable with a gentle learning curve for novice users.  As a free, browser-based, open source simulation tool, BLUESIM creates the perfect balance between power and usability backed by strong documentation and an architecture that lends itself to future enhancements.
